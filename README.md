# A Brief Introduction
This is the homepage of Weizhi Xue, a freshman currently studying at the CCME, *id est* the College of Chemistry and ~~Madman~~ Molecular Engineering in Peking University. My hobbies include playing the piano, composing, reading English novels and drawing maps (Especially Metro lines!). I plan to major in chemistry (or Applied Chemistry maybe? I'm not 100% sure) and minor in computing.

While I have a superficial knowledge of the C/C++ language, Python, though much simpler, is a whole new ball game. (I first learned the idiom [here on CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/24/business/us-china-trade-war-japan-intl/index.html)) Therefore, it is crucial that I strive to master the Python language and ace in the computing class through my endeavor, thus paving way for further advancement into more advanced realms of computing and programming.
